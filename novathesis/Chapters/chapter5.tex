\chapter{Work Plan}
\label{cha:work_plan}

The following chapter presents a tentative plan for the work that will be developed to achieve the goal of the thesis.


\section{Overview}

The project is divided into six major development phases. The timeframes to complete each phase are summarized in figure \ref{fig:gantt}.

\section{Phases of Development}

The following is a more detailed explanation of what will be done in each phase of development.

\newpage

\textbf{Phase 1 - Further Research into State of the Art - 3 Weeks}

The first phase will consist of performing further research into the state of the art, building on top of the knowledge already acquired in the preparation phase.

An emphasis will be placed on exploring different simulation techniques and best practices since this will be crucial for phase two.

Three weeks should be an appropriate amount of time, considering that some level of experimentation will be required to not only learn different simulation techniques but also to better understand which will be the most appropriate for our use case. This phase may also lead to an overhaul of the function signatures that have been defined.

\vspace{0.25cm}

\textbf{Phase 2 - Simulator Architecture - 6 Weeks}

The second phase will consist of developing the simulator's architecture as well as implementing its core functionalities, building a solid foundation for phase 3.

More precisely, the result of this phase should be a simulation environment where it is possible to simulate different nodes that can communicate among themselves in a network, as well as a mechanism for extracting and aggregating relevant data from each node.

\textbf{Phase 3 - Implementation of Blockchain Protocolos - 6 Weeks}

Phase three will involve implementing blockchain-specific functionalities. 

The data structures and data structure operations will be implemented, as well as essential operations required to simulate the Bitcoin, Algorand and Ethereum protocols - the necessary block proposal, block validation, information propagation, block finalization, and incentive mechanism modules for each of the protocols.

\vspace{0.25cm}

\textbf{Phase 4 - Evaluation of the Implementation - 5 Weeks}

The fourth phase will consist of evaluating the implementations made in the previous phases, through simulation.

The Bitcoin, Algorand and Ethereum protocols will be simulated, and an objective analysis of the results will be performed.

The timeframe of five weeks should be appropriate, to account for possible bug fixing, optimizations, and adding new functionalities if needed.

\vspace{0.25cm}

\textbf{Phase 5 - Validation of the Simulation Environment - 5 Weeks}

Phase five will be validating the developed simulation environment, through simulating some expected use cases.

The same protocols will be simulated, varying their parameterizations and analyzing their results.

\vspace{0.25cm}

\textbf{Phase 6 - Writing the thesis - 5 Weeks}

Finally, phase six will consist of writing the thesis document and preparing the final presentation.
